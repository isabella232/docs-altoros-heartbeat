This documentation describes the Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform tile. Installing this tile
creates a service that enables operators and app developers to track all system and application metrics
from their Pivotal Platform installation in one place.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform is a multi-tenant monitoring service that uses Cloud Foundry's User Account and Authentication (UAA)
server to grant access to apps and resources based on the user roles and rights within a Pivotal Platform deployment. The service pulls,
stores, visualizes, and sends alerts on the metrics emitted by VMs, Pivotal Platform components, services, and apps running on Pivotal Platform.

The tile comes with pre-built integration with the following services available as Pivotal Platform tiles:

- [MySQL for Pivotal Platform](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql)
- [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Platform](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)
- [Redis for Pivotal Platform](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis)
- [Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform](https://network.pivotal.io/products/crunchy-postgresql)
- [Altoros Log Search for Pivotal Platform](https://network.pivotal.io/products/altoros-log-search)

This integration enables operators to monitor these services without any additional configuration.

The tile comes with pre-built integration with the following externally deployed services:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Memcached
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Concourse

Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform requires additional configuration to monitor these services.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform includes the following key features:

* **Pivotal Platform monitoring**: Collects metrics emitted by all components of Pivotal Platform
* **IaaS-level monitoring**: Collects metrics from CPU, memory usage, IO, network, VM states, and more, regardless of the underlying infrastructure
* **Third-party services monitoring**: Provides the ability to collect metrics from MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and more
* **Application monitoring**: Gathers standard metrics (CPU, memory, or disk usage), arbitrary metrics (gauges, counters, timings, sets),
  and HTTP-specific metrics (requests per second, status codes, error rates, and more)
* **SSO and multi-tenancy**: Uses the Cloud Foundry UAA service
  to control access to apps and resources based on user roles and rights within the platform.
  Multi-tenancy is implemented according to Cloud Foundry UAA roles.
  Dedicated shares of the solution are deployed to different spaces to collect metrics from the apps and services running within.
* **Alerts**: Can be defined for each dashboard panel, and allow users to get immediate notifications though email, Slack, and other notification channels.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To complete installation of Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform, you need the following:

* An AWS S3 bucket or WebDAV with credentials to store alert images from Grafana
* Alert notification endpoint (e.g. SMTP server for email notifications, Slack incoming webhook URL) with credentials
* CPU, RAM, and disk resources for seven VMs
* Internet connectivity between the networks where the Pivotal Platform deployment and Heartbeat are installed.
  Altoros recommends installing Heartbeat on the same network with Pivotal Platform.
* TCP 2003 and 8126, and UDP 8125 ports open in the firewall to accept connections from Pivotal Platform and services networks. Ports 2003 and 8125 are used to receive metrics. TCP 8126 is necessary for Load Balancer health checks.


## <a id="reqs"></a> Requirements

Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform has the following requirements:

* [Pivotal Application Service (formerly Elastic Runtime)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) v1.10.x, v1.11.x, v1.12.x, v2.0.x, and v2.1.x

* Installation of the collectd add-on for Pivotal Platform to enable Pivotal Platform component VMs and the VMs of any other BOSH-deployed services expose component metrics to Heartbeat.
For more information, see [Installing collectd Add-on for Pivotal Platform](installing-collectd.html).
* (Optional) If you want to enable collection of JMX metrics from Java apps, you will need a custom Java buildpack for Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform.
For more information, see [JMXTrans Agent Integration](jmxtrans.html).
* (Optional) If you want to enable collection of custom application metrics, you must integrate a StatsD library into the app's code.
  For more information, see [StatsD Integration](statsd.html).


## <a id="limitations"></a> Limitations

The Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform tile has the following limitations:

* Offline buildpack for collecting JMX metrics is unavailable. Only the online version of the buildpack from
  [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Altoros/java-buildpack/tree/jmx-agent-integration) can be used to collect JMX metrics from Java apps.
* Users are limited to using internal MariaDB to store internal Heartbeat data such as user sessions, mappings, dashboards, UI configs, etc.
* Downscaling with retained high availability is only possible to at least two back end instances.
