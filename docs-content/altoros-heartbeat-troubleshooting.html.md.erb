## <a id='heartbeat-troubleshooting'></a> Altoros Heartbeat Troubleshooting

Below is a list of common issues you may face when troubleshooting Heartbeat, as well as some ways to resolve them.

1. An error occurs when trying to open Grafana:
    Probably, there is an issue with MySQL. Please, check the status of MySQL VMs and the corresponding logs. If the MySQL cluster is down, run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -d altoros-heartbeat-... run-errand bootstrap</pre>

1. No new metrics appear in the dashboards:
    You have likely run out of disk space. Run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -d altoros-heartbeat-... ssh heartbeat -c 'df -h /var/vcap/store' | grep stdout</pre>
    If there is no free space left, you must scale **Persistent Disk Type** for **Heartbeat Pivotal Platform Monitoring backend job** VMs (**Resource Config** page).
    You will also receive an alert if any free space is available on Heartbeat's back ends.

1. You experience a delay in graphs visualization after using Heartbeat for a while:
    Run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -d altoros-heartbeat-... ssh heartbeat -c 'ss -o state close-wait | wc -l' | grep stdout</pre>
    If it returns a big value as an output (e.g. exceeding 100), run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -d altoros-heartbeat-... ssh heartbeat -c 'sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit restart go-carbon'</pre>
    You will also get an alert identifying the number of the **CLOSE_WAIT** connections on Heartbeat's back ends.

If the MySQL cluster used by your Heartbeat installation is broken,
see [Ð¡luster Behavior](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/v35/docs/cluster-behavior.md)
and [Bootstrapping](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/v35/docs/bootstrapping.md)
documentation of the MySQL BOSH release for guidance on how to eliminate the problem,
or [contact Altoros](index.html#feedback) for help.
