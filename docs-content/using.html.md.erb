This topic describes how to use Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform.


## <a id='create'></a> Create a Service Instance, Heartbeat for Developers

To start using Heartbeat, you must create an Altoros Heartbeat service instance inside your org/space.
After this, you can navigate to a URL in a browser to access the Altoros Heartbeat Grafana dashboard and log in using your Pivotal Platform username and password.
After login, you have access to Developer View.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to create service instances inside the org/space
   that grant users admin access rights to Altoros Heartbeat.
   These org/spaces are provided during the Grafana configuration step of the Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform installation process.</p>

To create an Altoros Heartbeat service instance, do the following:

1. Navigate to cf-marketplace:
      <pre class="terminal">cf marketplace
        Getting services from marketplace in org admin / space demo as admin...
    OK
    service              plans                               description
    app-autoscaler       standard                            Scales bound applications in response to load (beta)
    heartbeat            standard                            Heartbeat Monitoring Solution</pre>

1. Find Heartbeat in the list of the available services and select the service plan.
   Currently, only the standard service plan is available, so it is selected by default.

1. Create a service instance.
      <pre class="terminal">cf create-service heartbeat standard heartbeat</pre>


## <a id='update'></a> Update a Service Instance

Each time you rename an org/space, all service instances within that org/space need to be updated.
It can be done automatically through the **Heartbeat Grafana Bootstrap** errand or manually through a service update procedure.
Another case when you might need to update a service instance is to manually refresh dashboards for a specific org/space when the **Heartbeat Grafana Bootstrap** errand is disabled.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Altoros highly recommends keeping the <b>Heartbeat Grafana Bootstrap</b> errand enabled.
 For details, see <a href="installing.html#errands">Configure Errands</a>.</p>

To update an Altoros Heartbeat service instance, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">cf update-service heartbeat -c '{"version":some_new_number}'</pre>

`some_new_number` is a number greater than the number assigned to the service instance during the previous update.
If this is the first time the service instance is being updated, provide any number.

The most convenient approach is to use a Unix timestamp as `some_new_number`:

<pre class="terminal">cf update-service heartbeat -c "{\"version\":$(date +%s)}"</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <b>date</b> command is only available in Linux and macOS.
   For Windows, use a Unix timestamp generator,
   e.g. <a href="http://www.unixtimestamp.com/">http://www.unixtimestamp.com/</a>.</p>


## <a id='access'></a> Access the Altoros Heartbeat Dashboard

To access the Altoros Heartbeat dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard** and click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile.

    A prompt requesting permission to access Altoros Heartbeat will appear.
      <%= image_tag("images/using-prompt.png") %>

1. Click **Authorize**.


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure the Altoros Heartbeat Dashboard

The Altoros Heartbeat dashboard is based on open source Grafana software.
For information about creating and editing Grafana graphs and panels, see [Grafana documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/).


## <a id='viewing'></a> View Metrics from Pivotal Platform

Altoros Heartbeat offers the following Pivotal Platform deployment monitoring views: Admin View and User View.

### <a id='admin-view'></a> Admin View

A view from the admin org/space.

<%= image_tag("images/admin.png") %>

The dashboards accessible from the Admin View are:

**Overview** dashboards:

* The **Pivotal BOSH Overview dashboard** contains panels with BOSH health metrics, such as sum CPU and memory/swap usage, and VM availability.
* The **Pivotal Platform Overview** dashboard contain panels with metrics on the state of long-running processes,
  container count and capacity of remaining containers, % of running VMs, average CPU usage on cells,
  overall memory usage on cells, overall swap usage on cells, load average on cells, all TCP connections of routers,
  and all apps' CPU, memory and disk usage.

**Apps dashboards** cover app CPU and memory metrics, metrics on CPU usage and memory usage on Diego cell,
  disk usage, and HTTP requests/error/status code rates and response time.

**BOSH** dashboards:

* The Pivotal BOSH Overview dashboard contains panels with BOSH health metrics,
  such as sum CPU and memory/swap usage, and VM availability.
* The Pivotal BOSH VMs dashboard contains panels with metrics of any VM managed by BOSH, including CPU usage,
  LA 1 min, memory/swap usage, health, health timeline, health status, system disc usage, persistent disc usage,
  and ephemeral disc usage.

**Cf component** dashboards provide full overview of Pivotal Platform API Stats, installation capacity, and component-specific metrics from Consul, Diego, Etcd, Router, and UAA.

**Cf service** dashboards contain panels with service-specific metrics for various services (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ).

For more information about third-party services monitoring, see [Third-Party Services Monitoring](services-monitoring.html).

**Alerting dashboards** include panels with BOSH HM alerts, Diego alerts, and Heartbeat self-alerts.

To enable alerts after installing the Altoros Heartbeat for Pivotal Platform tile, do the following:

1. Configure [Alert Notification Channels](http://docs.grafana.org/alerting/notifications/)

1. Open dashboards with alerts (dashboards with tag **alerting**)

1. Click the save icon:

      <%= image_tag("images/diego-alerts.png") %>

As an example of a custom alerting dashboard, you can use <a href="examples/Example_of_Alerting_Dashboard.json"> to download this dashboard with alerts for Diego cell CPU and memory/swap usage and an alert for the percentage of running VMs in BOSH</a>.
Download and [import](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard) it to see how it works.

<%= image_tag("images/import-example-alerting-dashboard.png") %>

For information about creating and editing alerts in Grafana, see [Grafana documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/alerting/rules/).
